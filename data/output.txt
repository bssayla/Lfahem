loss or attribution only affects part of the object of the legacy the legatee receives the rest up to a third of the estate without the loss being taken into account for the calculation of this third

will inherit with my child or with my children or include such and such a person among my heirs or have such and such a person inherit from my property or in the case where the testator has a grandchild descended from his son or daughter let my grandchild inherit with my children The Tanzil is assimilated to the will and obeys the same rules However the rule of Tafadol which grants the heir a share double that of the heiress applies to Tanzil Section 317 When in the case of Tanzil there is a reserved heir Fardh and if the author of the Tanzil expressly expresses his wish to allocate to the beneficiary of the Tanzil a share equal to that of the heir to whom he is assimilated the determination of the shares is carried out by means of fractions oul and the Tanzil therefore leads to the reduction of each persons shares If the author of the Tanzil has not expressly expressed his wish to allocate to the beneficiary a share equal to that of the heir to whom he is assimilated the shares are calculated taking into account the existence among the heirs of the person established as an heir Monazzal who receives a share equal to that devolved to the heir to whom she is assimilated The remainder of the estate falling to the reserved heirs Fardh and others is shared among the beneficiaries as if there had been no  Tanzil whose existence therefore entails the reduction of the shares of all reserved heirs and asaba Section 318 When in the case of Tanzil there are no reserved heirs Fardh the person appointed as heir Monazzal is assimilated depending on the case to the male or female heirs Article 319 In the case of Tanzil when there are several people male or female appointed as heirs and the author of the Tanzil has expressed his will either to allocate to them the share that their father would have collected during his lifetime  or to substitute them the sharing is carried out between the beneficiaries in such a way that the man receives a share double that of the woman Article 320 Cases which cannot be resolved under the provisions governing the Tanzil are settled by referring to the provisions governing the will  BOOK VI OF SUCCESSION   TITLE I GENERAL

category there are several saba heirs by themselves the succession belongs to the one who is of the degree of kinship closest to the deceased 2 When in the category there are several heirs of the same degree priority is based on the strength of the kinship tie the first parent of the deceased has priority over the one who is a consanguineous relative 3 In the event of the existence of heirs of the

there are with the full brothers and sisters consanguineous brothers and sisters the former include the ancestor in the equation with the latter to prevent the ancestor from receiving too large a share of the inheritance Then if in the group of full brothers and sisters there is more than one sister these heirs take the share of the consanguineous brothers and sisters If there is only one full sister she receives her entire share of Fardh and the rest of the inheritance is shared between the consanguineous brothers and sisters the heir collects double the share of the heiress Section 361

heir double of the part of the heiress Section 365 The elmouchtaraka case The brother receives the same share as that of the sister in the elmouchtaraka case This assumes the presence of the husband the mother or grandmother two or more uterine brothers and sisters and one or more full brothers the uterine brothers and sisters and the full brothers and sisters share the third on an equal basis per head because they all come from the same mother Section 366 The elgharwyn case When there are the wife and the father and mother of the deceased the wife is entitled to a quarter the mother to a third of what remains of the estate  that is to say a quarter and the father receives the rest When the husband is in the presence of the father and mother of the deceased he receives half and the
